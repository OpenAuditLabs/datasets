# Workflow for Building the OpenAuditBenchmark Dataset

**Key Recommendation:**  
Establish clear, phased milestones — from initial dataset assessment through public release — ensuring **modularity**, **reproducibility**, and **governance** at every step.

---

## Phase 1: Assessment & Planning

### 1. Inventory Existing Sources
- Collect metadata and access points for:
  - SC-Bench
  - AutoMESC
  - VulnContractSet
  - SolidiFI-A
  - SolidiFI-BugLab
  - SWC Registry
  - SmartBugs
  - ContractWard
  - Any in-house audit repositories

### 2. Gap Analysis
- Compare coverage across:
  - SWC IDs
  - Real vs. synthetic samples
  - Patch availability
  - Severity labels
  - Exploit traces
  - Test suites
- Identify underrepresented domains:
  - L2 rollups
  - NFTs
  - DAOs

### 3. Specification of Requirements
- Finalize unified schema fields:
  - `contract_id`
  - `source`
  - Vulnerability metadata
  - `exploit_trace`
  - `patch`
  - `taxonomy_links`
- Define quality metrics:
  - AAS (Annotation Accuracy Score)
  - DDI (Data Diversity Index)
  - PVR (Patch Validation Rate)
  - SDB (Schema Definition Baseline)
- Define release tiers:
  - Public
  - Research
  - Red Team

### 4. Project Kickoff & Governance
- Form cross-functional team:
  - Security auditors
  - Data engineers
  - LLM specialists
- Establish steering committee to approve:
  - Access controls
  - Redaction policies
  - Release protocols

---

## Phase 2: Data Ingestion & Harmonization

### 1. Automated Harvesters
- Implement connectors to fetch:
  - Code
  - Annotations
  - Fixes
  - Traces from each source
- Create normalization scripts to convert formats (JSON, CSV, AST dumps) into the unified schema

### 2. Schema Validation Engine
- Build a lightweight pipeline to verify:
  - Required fields
  - Type constraints
  - Provenance tags
- Reject or flag records missing critical annotations (e.g., missing SWC tag or patch diff)

### 3. Multi-Tool Label Aggregation
- Run tools on every sample:
  - Slither
  - Mythril
  - SmartCheck
  - Semgrep
- Populate `tool_labels`
- Compute:
  - Majority-vote fields
  - Confidence scores


# OpenAuditBenchmark Workflow (Phases 3–6)

## 4. Database Harmonization
Aggregate confidence scores across tools to create:

- **confidence_weighted_label**
- **tool_agreement_percentage**

---

## Phase 3: Data Curation & Quality Assurance

### 1. Quality Metrics Implementation

**AAS (Annotation Accuracy Score)**  
- Compare automated tool labels against manual expert annotations  
- Sample 10–15% of dataset for manual validation  
- Calculate per-vulnerability-type accuracy rates  
- **Target:** >85% agreement with expert classifications  

**DDI (Data Diversity Index)**  
- Measure representation across:  
  - Vulnerability types (SWC categories)  
  - Contract complexity levels  
  - Blockchain networks (Ethereum mainnet, L2s)  
  - Application domains (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, governance)  
- **Target:** No single category dominates >40% of dataset  

**PVR (Patch Validation Rate)**  
- Verify patch effectiveness through:  
  - Before/after tool scanning  
  - Compilation verification  
  - Semantic diff analysis  
  - Expert review of high-impact fixes  
- **Target:** >90% of patches successfully remediate identified vulnerabilities  

**SDB (Schema Definition Baseline)**  
- Enforce unified schema compliance:  
  - Required fields populated: >95%  
  - Data type consistency: 100%  
  - Provenance tracking: Complete for all samples  
  - Cross-reference validation with source repositories  

---

### 2. Expert Validation Pipeline
- **Recruitment:** Assemble panel of 8–12 certified smart contract auditors  
- **Sampling Strategy:** Stratified random sampling across vulnerability types  
- **Review Process:**  
  - Independent dual review for critical vulnerabilities  
  - Consensus resolution for disagreements  
  - Quality calibration sessions monthly  
- **Annotation Guidelines:** Standardize severity scoring and taxonomy mapping  

---

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Duplicate Detection:**  
  - AST-based similarity analysis  
  - Bytecode hash comparison  
  - Source code fingerprinting  
- **Version Control:** Track Solidity compiler versions and compatibility  
- **Dependency Resolution:** Map external library dependencies and versions  
- **Format Standardization:** Convert all samples to unified JSON schema
